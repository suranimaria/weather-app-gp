**0. Before doing any of this, if you're using your own laptop/desktop, make sure you've got the latest versions of node and npm installed (npm v: 4.0.5 & node v: 7.4.0) :**

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

## Installation

**1. Download the "src" folder.**

## Dependencies

**2. Install the dependencies :**

```sh
npm install
```
If that does not work or fails, then try the following:

```sh
npm install --force
```
>


## Start a live-reload development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

> This is a full web server for your project. Any time you make changes within the `src` directory, it will rebuild and even refresh your browser.


**5. Generate a production build in `./build` :**

```sh
npm run build
```
